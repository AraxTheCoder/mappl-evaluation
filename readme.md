This repository contains the programs which were used in the paper for the seminar "Probabilistic Programming" in which the paper "Compiling Probabilistic Programs for Variable
Elimination with Information Flow" was presented.

The programs are modified version of the original evaluation code from [MAPPL Implementation](https://github.com/mappl-pldi24-ae/mappl-pldi24-a) adjusted to fit the example from the seminar paper.
